        <h2>HTML- HyperText MarkUp Language</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs,
            headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

            HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality.
            Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

            When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page.

        <p>

            HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser
            (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content
            so that internet users can view it.

            Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, about pages,
            contact pages would all have separate HTML documents.

            Each HTML page consists of a set of tags (also called elements), which you can refer to as the building
            blocks of web pages. They create a hierarchy that structures the content into sections, paragraphs,
            headings, and other content blocks.

            Cons of HTML
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">
                    Mostly used for static web pages. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a
                    backend language such as PHP

                    It does not allow the user to implement logic. As a result, all web pages need to be created
                    separately, even if they use the same elements, e.g. headers and footers.
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                    Some browsers adopt new features slowly.

                <li class="list">
                    Browser behavior is sometimes hard to predict (e.g. older browsers don’t always render newer tags).
