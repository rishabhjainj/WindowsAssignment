        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript can be learned quickly and easily and used for a wide variety of purposes, from simply enhancing
            the functionality of a website to running games and web-based software. Better still, there are thousands of
            JavaScript templates and applications available for free thanks to sites like Github.</p>

            What makes JavaScript great?
        </h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript has a number of advantages that make it a better choice than its competitors, especially in
            certain use cases. Just a few of the benefits to using JavaScript include:
            <br><br>
            1. You do not need a compiler because web browsers interpret it with HTML.<br>
            2. It’s easier to learn than other programming languages.<br>
            3. Errors are easier to spot and therefore to correct.<br>
            4. It can be assigned to certain web page elements or specific events such as clicks or mouseovers.<br>
            5. JS works across multiple browsers, platforms, etc.<br>
            6. You can use JavaScript to validate inputs and reduce the need for manual data checks.<br>
            7. It makes websites more interactive and holds visitors’ attentions.<br>
            8. It’s faster and more lightweight than other programming languages.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">
            What are JavaScript’s weaknesses?
        </h3>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            1. Vulnerable to exploits.<br>
            2. Can be used to execute malicious code on a user’s computer.<br>
            3. Not always supported by different browsers and devices.<br>
            4. JS code snippets are quite large.<br>
            5. Can be rendered differently on different devices leading to inconsistency.<br>
